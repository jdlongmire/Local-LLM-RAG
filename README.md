# 🚀 Local LLM with RAG & Web UI

Welcome to **Local LLM with RAG**—a slick, offline AI chat system running on your Windows PC! Upload your PDFs or text files, query away, and get smart answers powered by a local language model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). No cloud, no fuss—just your machine and some clever code.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Local LLM**: Runs `phi-3` (3.8B params) via Ollama—fast and lightweight.
- **RAG Magic**: Indexes your docs in `C:\MyLLM\data` for context-aware responses.
- **Web UI**: Flask-powered interface at `localhost:5000` with file upload and query input.
- **Offline**: After setup, no internet needed—just you and your AI.
- **Performance**: Optimized with startup indexing and context limits.

## 🛠 System Architecture

### Overview
A self-hosted LLM with RAG, built for Windows 10/11, blending Python, Rust, and a web frontend.

### Components
- **Hardware**: Windows PC, CPU-based (GPU optional), 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended).
- **Software Stack**:
  - **Python 3.12.7**: Core runtime (3.13 had PyO3 issues).
  - **Rust**: Compiles `tokenizers` for `transformers` (via PyO3).
  - **Ollama**: Runs `phi-3` locally (swapped from slow `llama3`).
  - **Flask**: Hosts the UI.
  - **ChromaDB**: Vector store for RAG embeddings.
  - **Sentence Transformers**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for fast embeddings.
  - **PyPDF2**: PDF text extraction.
  - **PowerShell**: `setup_llm.ps1` for automation.
- **Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  numpy==1.26.4
  transformers==4.44.2
  accelerate==0.34.2
  sentence-transformers==3.2.0
  flask
  chromadb
  ollama
  PyPDF2

Data Flow
Setup: setup_llm.ps1 installs everything, pulls phi-3.
Startup: app.py indexes data/ into ChromaDB (~30s).
Query:
Upload: Saves to data/, re-indexes.
Query: Embeds input, searches ChromaDB, generates with phi-3 (~2-10s).
Output: UI shows response and timing.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Windows 10/11
Internet (for initial setup)
Steps
Install Python 3.12.7:
Download from python.org.
Check “Add to PATH” during install.
Verify: python --version (should show 3.12.7).
Install Rust:
Get rustup-init.exe from rustup.rs.
Run it, accept defaults.
Verify: rustc --version (e.g., 1.81.0).
Clone & Run Setup:
powershell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
.\setup_llm.ps1
Follow prompts: Use C:\MyLLM (default), choose “1” (internet mode).
Installs Python deps, Ollama, pulls phi-3.
Start the App:
powershell
python C:\MyLLM\app.py
Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
Use It:
Upload .txt or .pdf files via the UI.
Query (e.g., “Summarize this”)—watch the magic!
📈 Performance
Indexing: ~30s at startup/upload.
Query: 2-10s with phi-3 (CPU-dependent).
Tweakable: Swap to gemma:2b (ollama pull gemma:2b) or add GPU support.
🛠 Our Journey
Python 3.13 Fail: PyO3 in tokenizers didn’t support it—switched to 3.12.
Rust Surprise: Needed for tokenizers compilation.
Slow llama3: 7B params lagged (10-30s); phi-3 (3.8B) sped it up.
Indexing Lag: Moved from per-query to startup/upload.
Context Bloat: Limited to 1000 chars for faster inference.
🎉 Try It Out!
Share this with your tech crew—tweak app.py for other models or boost it with a GPU. Questions? Hit me up in the issues tab!

### How to Use This
1. **Create a GitHub Repo**:
   - Go to GitHub, click “New Repository,” name it (e.g., `Local-LLM-RAG`), and initialize with a README.
2. **Add Files**:
   - Copy this Markdown into `README.md`.
   - Upload `setup_llm.ps1` and `app.py` (latest versions I gave you) to the repo.
3. **Push It**:
   - Commit and push to GitHub.
   - Share the repo URL with your buddies!

### Cool Formatting Highlights
- **Emojis**: Adds flair (🚀, 🌟, ⚙️).
- **Headers**: Bold sections for readability.
- **Code Blocks**: Cleanly formats commands and paths.
- **Diagram**: Simple ASCII art for the architecture.

### Final Touches
- Replace `<your-repo-url>` and `<repo-name>` with your actual repo details.
- Add your name if you want credit!
- If you’ve got a specific response time (e.g., “5.2s”), I can update the performance section.

This README’s ready to wow your tech friends—let me know if you want any tweaks before you share it! What’s your latest query time with `phi-3`?
